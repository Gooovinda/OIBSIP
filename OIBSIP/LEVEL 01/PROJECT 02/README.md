# Project 02: Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 🌍 Objective

The main objective of this project was to segment customers based on their behavior and purchasing patterns. This segmentation helps businesses create targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance their services.

## ⚖️ Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for KMeans Clustering)

## 📅 Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning:**

   * Checked for missing values and duplicates.
   * Standardized column names and corrected data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Analyzed customer demographics (age, gender).
   * Visualized total spending behavior and product interest.

3. **Feature Engineering:**

   * Selected relevant features such as Age, Total Spend, and Purchase Frequency.
   * Scaled the data using StandardScaler for clustering.

4. **Clustering with KMeans:**

   * Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   * Applied KMeans algorithm to segment customers.
   * Assigned cluster labels to each customer.

5. **Visualization of Clusters:**

   * Plotted clusters using scatter plots and pair plots.
   * Interpreted clusters based on characteristics.

## 📊 Outcome

* Successfully segmented the customers into meaningful groups.
* Found insights such as high-value customers, frequent buyers, and budget-conscious segments.
* These insights can help businesses personalize marketing and improve retention.
