## 📊 Project 01 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

### 👨‍💻 Objective:

In this project, I explored and compared two distinct datasets to uncover insights into customer behavior and product patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

### 📁 Datasets Used:

1. **Retail Transaction Dataset**

   * Fields included: `Transaction ID`, `Date`, `Customer ID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Product Category`, `Quantity`, `Price per Unit`, `Total Amount`.
   * Focused on analyzing purchase behavior based on demographics and product categories.

2. **McDonald's Menu Nutrition Dataset**

   * Contained nutritional facts for various food items.
   * Analyzed to discover health-related insights, such as high-calorie items, fat-heavy foods, and portion comparisons.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:

* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning and analysis
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualizations
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations

### 🔍 Steps Performed:

* Cleaned both datasets for missing values and inconsistent formats
* Conducted univariate and multivariate analysis
* Visualized gender and age-wise product preferences
* Compared category-wise spending in the retail dataset
* Analyzed calorie content vs. other nutritional aspects in McDonald's data
* Generated bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps

### 📈 Key Outcomes:

* In the retail dataset, **Clothing and Beauty** were top-selling categories, with males being more frequent buyers.
* In the McDonald's dataset, items like **Big Breakfast with Hotcakes** had extreme calorie, fat, and sodium levels.
* The comparison provided both business and health-oriented insights using EDA techniques.

### 📌 Notes:

* Datasets used are kept zipped due to file size. Dataset sources and download links are provided separately.
