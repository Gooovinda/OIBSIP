🏠 Project 04: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
🔍 Objective:
In this project, I built a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on various numerical features. This project provided hands-on experience in implementing regression algorithms and evaluating model performance on real-world data.

🧠 Steps Performed:
Data Loading and Exploration

Loaded a CSV dataset containing features like area income, house age, number of rooms, etc.

Explored the structure and statistical summary of the data.

Data Cleaning

Checked and handled missing values.

Dropped unnecessary columns like Address.

Feature Selection

Selected relevant numerical features for prediction.

Defined X as feature variables and y as the target price column.

Model Building

Used LinearRegression from Scikit-Learn.

Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20).

Trained the model on the training set.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared Score (R²)

Achieved a strong R² score of ~0.91, indicating a good fit.

Visualization

Created a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted house prices using matplotlib.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, metrics)

Matplotlib

📊 Outcome:
The Linear Regression model accurately predicted house prices with a high R² value. This project helped me understand how simple regression models work and how to interpret them in a real-world scenario.
