📁 Project 05: Wine Quality Prediction
🔍 Objective:
In this project, my goal was to build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics. This was a great real-world application of classification models and helped deepen my understanding of model comparison, evaluation, and interpretation.

📊 Dataset Used:
Wine Quality Dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset]
It includes physicochemical features like:

Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar

pH, sulphates, alcohol, and more

Target: quality (wine quality score)

🔧 Tools & Libraries:
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

✅ Steps Performed:
Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values and data types

Verified class balance and quality distribution

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Created visualizations to understand distribution and correlation of features

Insights like: Alcohol and volatile acidity had strong relationships with wine quality

Model Building:

I used three classifiers to compare performance:

Random Forest Classifier

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Evaluation:

Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

Random Forest performed the best among all three

📈 Outcome:
Achieved high accuracy in classifying wine quality, especially with Random Forest.

Learned how small chemical differences impact wine classification.

Understood the significance of model comparison in real-world datasets.
