## 📁 Project 06: Fraud Detection
## 🔍 Objective:
In this project, I focused on detecting fraudulent transactions using a real-world credit card dataset. The main goal was to apply machine learning models to identify anomalies that signify fraud in financial systems.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Steps Performed:
Data Loading & Inspection: Loaded the dataset and verified the shape, missing values, and column details.

Class Distribution Analysis: Observed that the dataset is highly imbalanced with only ~0.17% fraud cases.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized class imbalance and correlation heatmaps.

Data Preprocessing: Scaled features like 'Amount' and split the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Model Evaluation:

Used confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate models.

Focused on recall due to the importance of identifying fraud correctly.

## 📊 Outcome:
Achieved a good recall score while keeping false positives under control. The Decision Tree classifier gave a better balance between precision and recall for fraud detection.
