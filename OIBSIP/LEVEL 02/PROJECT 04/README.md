## 📁 Project 07: Unveiling the Android App Market: Analyzing Google Play Store Data
## 🔍 Objective:
In this project, I analyzed Google Play Store data to uncover trends, user preferences, and insights into app performance across categories. The goal was to understand app distribution, pricing, ratings, and user sentiments.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Datasets Used:
App Data: Included information like app name, category, ratings, reviews, size, installs, type (Free/Paid), price, and content rating.

User Reviews Data: Included translated user reviews along with sentiment labels and polarity/subjectivity scores.

## 🧹 Steps Performed:
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and converted data types (e.g., installs, price, size).

Removed duplicates and fixed formatting issues.

Category Exploration:

Counted number of apps in each category.

Visualized category-wise app distribution.

Metrics Analysis:

Explored relationships between app size, installs, price, and ratings.

Identified most popular free and paid apps.

Sentiment Analysis:

Used review dataset to classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

Analyzed polarity and subjectivity of reviews per app.

Interactive Visualizations:

Created bar charts, scatter plots, and sentiment distribution plots.

## 📊 Key Insights:
FAMILY, GAME, and TOOLS categories dominate the app count.

Free apps are more common, but paid apps tend to have slightly better ratings.

Many apps have low installs despite good ratings—indicating visibility is a key factor.

Positive sentiment dominates user reviews, but critical feedback appears for utility and performance issues.
