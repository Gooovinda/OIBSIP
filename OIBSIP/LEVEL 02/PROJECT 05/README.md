## 📁 Project 08: Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics
## 🔍 Objective:
The goal of this project was to explore the implementation of autocomplete and autocorrect functionalities using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This is essential for improving user typing experience in applications such as search engines, messaging platforms, and editors.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

NLTK

TextBlob

Streamlit (for building the GUI)

Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset Used:
A small custom dataset of English sentences was used for demonstration purposes, simulating user input for autocomplete and autocorrect logic.

## 🧹 Steps Performed:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and tokenized the input text.

Removed punctuation and unnecessary symbols.

Autocomplete Logic:

Implemented simple word prediction using prefix matching from a word list.

Autocorrect Logic:

Used TextBlob to correct spelling errors.

GUI Development:

Created a simple user interface using Streamlit.

User inputs a word or phrase, and the app returns suggestions or corrections in real-time.

## 💻 How to Run the App:
Make sure you're in the project folder in terminal.

Run the following command:

arduino
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Enter a word or sentence to see autocomplete suggestions and spelling corrections.

## 📊 Key Learnings:
Understood how autocomplete and autocorrect mechanisms work in real-world applications.

Practiced text preprocessing, tokenization, and spelling correction using basic NLP tools.

Learned to deploy a simple NLP-based application with a GUI using Streamlit.

## 🔗 Dataset Info:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud]
This project used a custom list of sample English sentences.

For real-world use, large-scale corpora such as Wikipedia Dumps or Common Crawl can be used.
